                My name is Jayson. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. This site was created using
                React, CSS and Semantic UI. Check out some of my work with the 'Projects' tab in the
                menu above. Find ways to contact me and links to my social media in the 'Contact Me' tab.<br/><br/>

                I graduated from Flatiron School's Software Engineering bootcamp where I learned web
                development skills over 15 weeks. It is one of the hardest things I've ever accomplished, but
                the software engineering knowledge I gained throughout is priceless.<br/><br/>                

                I am a full stack developer with experience building web applications using JavaScript and React. 
                I've also used Python and Flask to set up databases and APIs. For my final project at Flatiron School,
                I built a mobile application using React Native.
